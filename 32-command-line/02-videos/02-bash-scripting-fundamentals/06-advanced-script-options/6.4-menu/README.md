# Creating Menu Interfaces

- The select statement can be used to create a menu interface
  - select DIR in /bin /usr /etc
- In this, DIR is the variable that will be filled with the selected choice, and /bin /usr /etc are presented as numbered menu options
- Notice the use of break in select, without it the script would run forever
