## Commands

A command can be one of four things

> An executable program

files in /usr/bin. Within this category, programs can be compiled binaries, such as programs written in C and C++,
or programs written in scripting languages, such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, and so on.

> A command built into the shell itself

bash supports a number of commands internally called shell builtins. For example, the cd command is a shell builtin.

> A shell function

shell functions are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment.

> An alias

an alias is a command that we can define ourselves, built from other commands.
