# Producer and Consumer

Queues are great if you wish to provide a single pipeline for work distribution. 
Items can be concurrently offered onto it before taken off in parallel by the workers. 

## Consumers - client workers

1, right Consumer App.main() to launch two consumer processes (2 client workers)

## Producer

1, right Producer App.main() to launch one producer process to offer 8 items to client workers
