# Actor System and Hierarchical Structure

- Actor System and hierarchical structure
- Actor components and lifecycle
- Creating actor with Props
- Talking to an Actor
- Supervision and monitoring

## Hierarchical structure for actors

- The actor is an object which encapsulates state and behavior
- The actors communicate by exchanging messages
- Actors like persons

```
     [Project Owner]-------[Project Manager]-------[Client]
                                   |
                         --------------------
                         |                  |
                   [Team Leader]       [Team Leader]
                    |                   |
                    |-[Designer]        |-[Designer]
                    |                   |
                    |-[QA]              |-[QA]
                    |                   |
                    |-[Developer]       |-[Developer]
```

```
                               [Actor]
                                  |
                        -----------------------
                        |      |       |      |
                    [child] [child] [child] [child]  
```

## What's the Actor System

- The Actor System is our root on actors structure
- The Actor System as a collaborating failure ensemble of actors is the natural unit for managing shared facilities 
like scheduling services, configuration, and logging

## Actor System components

```
                  [Configuration]   [Event System]
                            \          /
    [Dead Letter Office] - [Actor System] - [Scheduler]
                            /          \
           [User Guardian Actor]   [System Guardian Actor]
```
