# Bracket Expressions and Character Classes

`bracket expressions` - match a single character from a specified set of characters

> Setup - foo1.txt and foo2.txt

```
$ cat foo1.txt
unzip
zip
zipinfo
bzip
zipnote
bzip2
gzip

$ cat foo2.txt
czip
gzip3
```

> Test - grep bzip and gzip matches

```
$ grep -h '[bg]zip' foo*.txt
bzip
bzip2
gzip
gzip3
```

> within bracket expressions

- `[^ab]` - `^` indicates negation
- `[a-b]` - `-` indicates a character range

## Negation

When `^` is the first character, the remaining characters must not be present.

> Test - grep not bzip and gzip matches

```
$ grep -h '[^bg]zip' foo*.txt
unzip
czip
```

## Traditional Character Ranges

### Example - find matches begins with an uppercase letter

> Setup - foo1.txt and foo2.txt

```
$ cat foo1.txt
Tom
abc
Harry
xyz

$ cat foo2.txt
123
Apple
eat
```

> Test

matches starting with an uppercase letter

```
$ grep -h '^[A-Z]' foo*.txt
Tom
Harry
Apple
```

matches starting with letters and numbers

```
$ grep -h '^[A-Za-z0-9]' foo*.txt
Tom
abc
Harry
xyz
123
Apple
eat
```
