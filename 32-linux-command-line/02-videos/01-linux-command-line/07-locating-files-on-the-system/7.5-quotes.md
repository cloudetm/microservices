# Bash tip: Protect special characters with quotes

## "" - double quote evaluate expression and protect some special characters such as *

```
[osboxes@osboxes lesson7]$ echo this is text with *
this is text with file1 file2 folder1
[osboxes@osboxes lesson7]$ echo "this is text with *" <- protect special character *
this is text with *
```

## '' - single quote protect all special characters

```
[osboxes@osboxes lesson7]$ echo "this is text with $MAIL"
this is text with /var/spool/mail/osboxes
[osboxes@osboxes lesson7]$ echo 'this is text with $MAIL' <- protect all special characters including expression character such as $
this is text with $MAIL
```

## \ - backslash protects one character

```
[osboxes@osboxes lesson7]$ echo this is text with *
this is text with file1 file2 folder1
[osboxes@osboxes lesson7]$ echo this is text with \* <- protect one special character * by using \
this is text with *
```
