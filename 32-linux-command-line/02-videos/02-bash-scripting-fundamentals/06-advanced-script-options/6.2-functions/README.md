# Using Functions

- Functions are useful if code is repeated frequently
- Functions must be defined before they can be used
- It is good practice to define all functions at the beginning of a script
- Syntax approach 1:

```
function help
{
  echo this is how you do it
}
```

- Syntax approach 2:

```
help (){
{
  echo this is how you do it
}
```
