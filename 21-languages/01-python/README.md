## Polymorphism in Python

```
def times(x, y):  # Create and assign function
   return x * y  # Body executed when called
times(2, 4)  # Arguments in parentheses
times('Ni', 3)  # Functions are "typeless"

The simple times function depends kinds of objects that x and y are.
The same function can perform multiplication in one instance and repetition in another.
Python leaves it up to the objects to do something reasonable for the syntax.
* is just a dispatch mechanism that routes control to the objects being processed.

This sort of type-dependent behavior is known as polymorphism.
The meaning of the operation depends on the objects being operated upon.
Because itâ€™s a dynamically typed language, every operation is a polymorphic operation in Python:
printing, indexing, the * operator, and much more.
```
