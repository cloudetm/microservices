# point-to-point

The sender can use either the default exchange or a direct exchange (that uses the routing key to determine to which
queue a message must be sent; the routing key should match the binding key between the exchange and the queue). The
Receiver class can be used to subscribe to a particular queue and receive messages from that queue.

## Run Apps

### sender
1, launch sender app

2, go to http://localhost:15672/#/queues a new `event_queue` Ready item added to the queue. if not, run it again until
you see >= 1 Ready.

### receiver
1, launch receiver app

2, try to dequeue two items from http://localhost:15672/#/queues because there are two receivers
